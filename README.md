*************----------Content----------*************<br>
* --PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb (Jupyter Source File) - Solved the assignment in different ways other than using the code provided using class material and learning
* --PyCitySchools_starter_Completed.ipynb (Jupyter Source File) - Solved the assignment in the format shared using the pre-written code provided
* --Resources folder contains the data set used for this assingment (schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv)<br>

*************----------To Execute the Jupyter source file ----------*************<br>

* --Open the PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb (Jupyter Source File) using Visual studio code
* --Ensure correct Kernell is selected. Please use References.pdf for pre-requisite checklist
* --Ensure required dataset is under Resources folder and the Resource folder is placed in the same level as the Jupyter source file is placed to avoid error. Refer Reference pdf.
* --Click Run All or Run individual code in sequence it is written. Running the code block in between might throw error as the variables used in that code block might be defined in the prior code block. Hence recommended to Run All to ensure it is run in sequence.

The same steps to be followed when trying to execute "PyCitySchools_starter_Completed.ipynb (Jupyter Source File)".

<b>*************----------To Execute the Jupyter source file ----------*************</b><br>

* --Open the PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb (Jupyter Source File) using Visual studio code
* --Ensure correct Kernell is selected. Please use References.pdf for pre-requsite checklist
* --Ensure required dataset is under Resources folder and the Resource folder is placed in the same level as the jupyter source file is placed to aovid error. Refer Reference pdf.
* --Click Runall or Run individual code in sequence it is written. Running the code block inbetween might throw error as the variables used in that code block might used from prior code block. Hence recommended to Runall to ensure it is run in sequence.

The same steps to be followed when trying to execute "PyCitySchools_starter_Completed.ipynb (Jupyter Source File)".

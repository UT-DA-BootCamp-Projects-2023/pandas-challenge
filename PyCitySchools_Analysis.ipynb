    "## Analysis Summary \n",
    "**Data analysis on PyCity schools is done to uncover any factor that impacts or improves school performance, budget, or any other priorities**<br>\n",
    "    ***This data analysis looks for pattern/trends across these schools with the given data dataset**\n",
    "* As first step data is looked at over all district level and performed overall analysis on students’ math score, reading score, passing rate and school budget\n",
    "* As next step, drill down analysis is performed at each school level on students’ math score, reading score, passing rate, school budget and also<br>\n",
    "    *  Computing the overall passing rate by each school and reviewing the data for trends with highest and lowest performing school <br>\n",
    "    *  Computing the average Math and Reading score by each grade and reviewing against each school <br>\n",
    "* To further get more clarity on which factor has more impact on performance, a further drill down analysis is done as listed below <br>\n",
    "    *  Comparing the scores of each school by their spending <br>\n",
    "    *  Comparing the scores of each school by their school size <br>\n",
    "    *  Comparing the scores of each school by their school type <br>\n",
    "***                  \n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "* While it is evident from the Grade level analysis done for each school shows no variance in performance with respect to each of their grade level, From the school summary snapshot all schools have performed better in Reading when compared to Math.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on highest and lowest performing school analysis and also using further drill down analysis by specific spending, school size and school type bins, it evident that highest performing schools have lower budget, lower student count(that is school size is either small or medium size) and are of charter school type while the lowest performing schools have higher budget, higher student count(that is large school size) and are of district school type.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "Please note that below listed limitations may (or may not) have impact with respect to the conclusions derived for this data analysis<br>\n",
    "* Though District level data analysis has been performed, there is no other measures like other district data or budget and overall performance rate metrics shared to compare district level data.<br>\n",
    "* Details of budget spending by each school data set is missing, that is how the budgets are utilized by each school kind of dataset is missing which might also play key factor in school performance"
